# some-voices

一件想做了挺久的事了。

每个人都应该有说话的权利。既然做不到，那就帮忙记录吧。

> 这几天真的好难受的，即使她的文字再过乐观都很难切身感受到她所经历的肉体与精神的折磨。上一次刷微博看到抑郁是20年李医生去世的时候，见证了一条一条消失的#我要ylzy#，以及一觉过后只剩下对国家的不真实的称赞。
> 
> 再往前可能是17年国乒集体声援刘国梁后的大规模删帖事件。互联网没有记忆，或者说中国互联网没有记忆，中国媒体也没有记忆，最难以理解的是连02年世界杯的名单都需要因为政治进行删减。
希望可以看到从“央视姓党，绝对忠诚” 回归“群众喉舌，舆论监督”的一天。注意是群众，不是人民。

> 无法理解为什么看到她的新微博后要做的第一件事竟然是先截屏。可若是选择不帮忙记录被一个公权打压的“人！”的声音，自己良心上是会过不去的。

Something I've been longing for doing for a long time.

Everyone should have the right to speak. Since that's not the real case in China, we should help record the voices of the people.

> These days are really uncomfortable, even if her words are too optimistic, it is difficult to feel the physical and mental torture she has experienced. The last time I saw depression on Weibo was when Dr. Li passed away 20 years ago, and I witnessed the disappearance of #I need Freedom of Speech# one by one, and after a night, only unreal praise for the country remained.

> Going forward may be the large-scale deletion of posts after the national table tennis collectively supported Liu Guoliang in 2017. The Internet has no memory, or the Chinese Internet has no memory, and neither does the Chinese media. The most difficult thing to understand is that even the 2002 World Cup player list needs to be "updated" because of politics.
I hope to see the day when "CCTV surnamed the party, absolute loyalty" returns to "the mouthpiece of the masses and the supervision of opinion of the citizens". Note that it is the citizens, not the "people" in Chinese definition.

> Can't understand why the first thing I did after seeing her new Weibo was to take a screenshot. But if I chose not to help record the voice of a "person!" suppressed by the authority, I would have a hard time on my conscience.
